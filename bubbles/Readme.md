# Exercise: Bubble Bath - Fill the Tub #

## Exercise:
* Fill a bath – continuous flow from faucets (hot and/or cold)
* The bath should be filled and then, when it is full, the owner alerted that the bath is ready
* The bath should contain bubble-bath, but that can only be added once the bath is at least half full, but no more than ¾ full

## Caution: 
* It is very easy to build models that allow multiple parallel use of the same continuous action
* It is also very easy to create models that are non-linear or that push POPF beyond its current envelope
